# React Native Audio CarPlay

React Native Audio CarPlay is a library that enables audio integration with Android Auto using React Native. With this library, you can easily develop audio-focused apps that work seamlessly with these in-car entertainment systems.

## Features

- Audio playback: Play audio files from your app with the built-in player.
- Audio controls: Control audio playback with the in-car controls provided by CarPlay and Android Auto.
- Metadata: Display audio metadata such as track name, artist, and album art in the in-car entertainment system.
- Seamless integration: Integrate your audio app with CarPlay and Android Auto without needing to write native code.

Then, you can import the library in your React Native app and start integrating it with your audio components.

```javascript
import AudioPlayer from 'react-native-audio-carplay';

// Use the AudioPlayer component in your app to play audio files and control playback
<AudioPlayer source={require('./path/to/audio/file.mp3')} />
```

Future Plans
Adding to npm: We plan on publishing this library to npm so that it can be easily installed and integrated into your React Native projects.
CarPlay support: We are currently working on adding support for CarPlay so that your audio-focused React Native apps can seamlessly integrate with in-car entertainment systems. Stay tuned for updates!
We plan on integrating our audio library with react-native-track-player, a popular audio player library for React Native. This will allow you to use our library to control the audio playback and display metadata in react-native-track-player. We are currently working on this feature and will update this README.md file with instructions once it's available.
