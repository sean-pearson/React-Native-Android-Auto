# React Native Audio CarPlay

React Native Audio CarPlay is a library that enables audio integration with Android Auto using React Native. With this library, you can easily develop audio-focused apps that work seamlessly with these in-car entertainment systems.

## Features

- Audio playback: Play audio files from your app with the built-in player.
- Audio controls: Control audio playback with the in-car controls provided by CarPlay and Android Auto.
- Metadata: Display audio metadata such as track name, artist, and album art in the in-car entertainment system.
- Seamless integration: Integrate your audio app with CarPlay and Android Auto without needing to write native code.

## Future Plans
- Adding to npm: We plan on publishing this library to npm so that it can be easily installed and integrated into your React Native projects.
- CarPlay support: We are currently working on adding support for CarPlay so that your audio-focused React Native apps can seamlessly integrate with in-car entertainment systems. Stay tuned for updates!
- We plan on integrating our audio library with react-native-track-player, a popular audio player library for React Native. This will allow you to use our library to control the audio playback and display metadata in react-native-track-player. We are currently working on this feature and will update this README.md file with instructions once it's available.
- Enable seamless integration of custom colors and icons.
